//! Plugin resolver trait for lazy, dynamic resolution of super-global objects.
//!
//! Plugins implement `PluginResolver` to provide objects (like `Math`, `console`)
//! that are available in the super-global scope. Objects are resolved lazily —
//! only when JS code actually references them.

/// super-global scope. The first resolver that claims a name wins.
